Get your tickets here: http://bit.ly/Frozen2TicketsWhy was Elsa born with magical powers? What truths about the past await Elsa as she ventures into the unknown to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond Arendelle? The answers are calling her but also threatening her kingdom. Together with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she'll face a dangerous but remarkable journey. In “Frozen,” Elsa feared her powers were too much for the world. In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity. It’s not a “whodunit,” it’s a “whosungit!”#TheMaskedSinger #TheReveal The Flower Is Revealed As Patti LaBelle | Season 2 Ep. 8 | THE MASKED SINGERhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MaskedSingerFOX"

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

Was it really a meritless suit or is there more to the story?  If you’re in the market for a great suit, I can’t recommend Indochino highly enough and Legal Eagles get a discount!  https://bit.ly/2IeeB8WSummary from Vulture: Remember back in 2017 when John Oliver did a Last Week Tonight segment about coal company CEO and “geriatric Dr. Evil” Bob Murray, then — as predicted — was sued by Bob Murray the following week? Oliver couldn’t discuss the lawsuit while it was ongoing, but we did get an update when the case was dismissed in February 2018, when Oliver, referencing the original segment, told Murray to “eat shit.” What you might not know, however, is that Murray appealed the case after it was dismissed, so Oliver was yet again forced into silence until the case was recently dropped. Which brings us to last night’s Last Week Tonight, when Oliver was finally free to recap the entire saga … and, in doing so, to start a whole new saga too.(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video)------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Welcome to Real Law Review by LegalEagle; a series where I try to tackle the most important legal issues of the day.

While on a forgettable first date together in Ohio, a black man (Get Out’s Daniel Kaluuya) and a black woman (Jodie Turner-Smith, in her first starring feature-film role), are pulled over for a minor traffic infraction. The situation escalates, with sudden and tragic results, when the man kills the police officer in self-defense. Terrified and in fear for their lives, the man, a retail employee, and the woman, a criminal defense lawyer, are forced to go on the run. But the incident is captured on video and goes viral, and the couple unwittingly become a symbol of trauma, terror, grief and pain for people across the country. As they drive, these two unlikely fugitives will discover themselves and each other in the most dire and desperate of circumstances, and will forge a deep and powerful love that will reveal their shared humanity and shape the rest of their lives. Joining a legacy of films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Thelma & Louise, Queen & Slim is a powerful, consciousness-raising love story that confronts the staggering human toll of racism and the life-shattering price of violence. Waithe wrote the script based on an original idea by bestselling author James Frey (A Million Little Pieces, Katerina). The feature-film directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas (executive producer of HBO’s Insecure) stars Academy Award® nominee Daniel Kaluuya as “Slim” and rising star Jodie Turner-Smith (Syfy’s Nightflyers), as “Queen.” Waithe produces the film via her company, Hillman Grad Productions, along with Matsoukas via her production company, De La Revolución Films. Frey produces via his production company, 3BlackDot, alongside Andrew Coles and Michelle Knudsen.

Her mom watched in disbelief as her daughter tried to break free. So how did Gracie Davidson find herself in such a bizarre situation? She was in the back seat of her mom's car when she fell asleep. When she woke up, somehow, her seatbelt was tightly wrapped around her waist and she couldn't release it. Police outside Dallas, Texas, were called, but this was unlike anything they'd ever experienced."

It’s the rarest, most expensive, and potentially the most dangerous material on earth. Scientists don’t know why this material is so rare. Anti-atoms took 72 years after we discovered antimatter to make. Why?Thanks to CERN, Elise Wursten, Loïc Bommersbach and Sarah Charleyhttp://physicsgirl.org/ http://twitter.com/thephysicsgirlhttp://facebook.com/thephysicsgirlhttp://instagram.com/thephysicsgirlCreator/Host: Dianna Cowern Editor: Levi Butner Research & Writing: Sophia Chen & Dianna & Imogen AshfordSources:Current estimate of Antimatter, courtesy of Elise : Stefan Ulmer made a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on energy and power consumption. The explanation goes as follows:  1.       CERN produces 3e7 antiprotons per AD cycle or about 1e15 per year2.       This is about 1e15*1.67e-27kg = 1.67 nanogram per year3.       1 gram of antiprotons has an energy (E=mc^2) of 9e13 Joule4.       The efficiency of the antiproton production process is 1e-9, so you need a billion times more energy: 9e22 Joule5.       The cost of power for CERN is 1kWh = 3.6e6 Joule = 0.1 euro6.       So that would make 0.1/3.6e6*9e22 = 2.5e15 euro7.

If you’re thinking that sounds familiar, then you much have been around for the first Motorola RAZR launch back in 2004! Despite its high price, that RAZR product family would go on to sell 130 million units over the next four years, going down in the history books as the most successful flip phone of all time. Can Motorola capture lightning in a bottle again? I recently got a sneak peek at the company's flexible-display flagship branded simply razr – and while my enthusiasm for the foldable category doubtless colors my impression, I came away hopeful for the Motorola brand name for the first time in four years.

In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough.

A millionaire by 26, Graham’s income fluctuates between $60,000 and $221,000 per month depending on how much he earns from real estate commissions and YouTube related-revenue. He also owns several rental properties in the Los Angeles area. Between his high income and budget-conscious nature (and 20 cent iced coffee), Graham saves nearly 99% of his income.This is the latest installment of Millennial Money, which profiles people across the U.S. and details how they earn and spend their money.Read more about Graham's budget breakdown here: https://cnb.cx/2QExENLGraham Stephan pulls up to a high-end Hollywood Hills property in his matte black Tesla Model 3. It’s a four-bed, 2,300-square-foot home listed for $2.169 million by The Oppenheim Group, where Stephan has worked as a realtor since 2015.He’s sold multiple properties like it — and every time he closes a deal, he collects a nice commission check.As of September 2019, Stephan has earned $77,152 in real estate commissions on the five properties he’s sold so far this year. But that represents just a fraction of his income. While the 29-year-old millionaire got his start in real estate, he now earns most of his money making YouTube videos.Stephan, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, never dreamed he’d make his living as a YouTuber. He was earning good money as a realtor, a career he started at 18 after he didn’t get into college. He’d watched YouTube videos for years — “it was my version of TV,” he tells CNBC Make It — but didn’t think he had the personality to be a creator himself. “It looked like such a fun thing to do and I’d always wanted to do it, but I also felt like, Who would want to watch me?”About three years ago, he decided to film and upload a video. It was an explainer on how to be a successful real estate agent that he shot “selfie-style” on his iPhone.“I remember that video getting nine or 10 views,” says Stephan, “and thinking, Oh my God, nine people somewhere have seen this video! So I started making more videos. Once I started doing about two videos a week, the growth really just exploded.”Today, Stephan has close to 1.5 million subscribers across two channels. He earns an average of $90,684 a month on the platform and will bring in well over $1 million for 2019. His videos cover a range of topics, from how to build wealth as a teen to buying a Tesla “for free.” And he regularly posts reaction videos to CNBC Make It’s Millennial Money series, offering commentary on how the subjects could improve their finances.This year will be the first time he’s earned seven figures in a calendar year, a milestone he’s been striving for since 2017. “Two years ago, I made a goal challenge video,” says Stephan. “My goal was to make $1 million in 2018.” He didn’t quite achieve it, but he surprised even himself by hitting it just a year later.» Subscribe to CNBC Make It.: http://cnb.cx/2kxl2rfAbout CNBC Make It.: CNBC Make It. is a new section of CNBC dedicated to making you smarter about managing your business, career, and money.Connect with CNBC Make It.

Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chair, said that Gordon Sondland's testimony was a seminal moment in our investigation, adding that the evidence brought forward by the U.S. ambassador to the European Union was deeply significant and troubling. Schiff spoke after the testimony from Sondland on Nov. 20, in a public hearing as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity. It’s not a “whodunit,” it’s a “whosungit!”#TheMaskedSinger #TheReveal The Flower Is Revealed As Patti LaBelle | Season 2 Ep. 8 | THE MASKED SINGERhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MaskedSingerFOX"

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

Was it really a meritless suit or is there more to the story?  If you’re in the market for a great suit, I can’t recommend Indochino highly enough and Legal Eagles get a discount!  https://bit.ly/2IeeB8WSummary from Vulture: Remember back in 2017 when John Oliver did a Last Week Tonight segment about coal company CEO and “geriatric Dr. Evil” Bob Murray, then — as predicted — was sued by Bob Murray the following week? Oliver couldn’t discuss the lawsuit while it was ongoing, but we did get an update when the case was dismissed in February 2018, when Oliver, referencing the original segment, told Murray to “eat shit.” What you might not know, however, is that Murray appealed the case after it was dismissed, so Oliver was yet again forced into silence until the case was recently dropped. Which brings us to last night’s Last Week Tonight, when Oliver was finally free to recap the entire saga … and, in doing so, to start a whole new saga too.(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video)------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Welcome to Real Law Review by LegalEagle; a series where I try to tackle the most important legal issues of the day.

He added, It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors."

While on a forgettable first date together in Ohio, a black man (Get Out’s Daniel Kaluuya) and a black woman (Jodie Turner-Smith, in her first starring feature-film role), are pulled over for a minor traffic infraction. The situation escalates, with sudden and tragic results, when the man kills the police officer in self-defense. Terrified and in fear for their lives, the man, a retail employee, and the woman, a criminal defense lawyer, are forced to go on the run. But the incident is captured on video and goes viral, and the couple unwittingly become a symbol of trauma, terror, grief and pain for people across the country. As they drive, these two unlikely fugitives will discover themselves and each other in the most dire and desperate of circumstances, and will forge a deep and powerful love that will reveal their shared humanity and shape the rest of their lives. Joining a legacy of films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Thelma & Louise, Queen & Slim is a powerful, consciousness-raising love story that confronts the staggering human toll of racism and the life-shattering price of violence. Waithe wrote the script based on an original idea by bestselling author James Frey (A Million Little Pieces, Katerina). The feature-film directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas (executive producer of HBO’s Insecure) stars Academy Award® nominee Daniel Kaluuya as “Slim” and rising star Jodie Turner-Smith (Syfy’s Nightflyers), as “Queen.” Waithe produces the film via her company, Hillman Grad Productions, along with Matsoukas via her production company, De La Revolución Films. Frey produces via his production company, 3BlackDot, alongside Andrew Coles and Michelle Knudsen.

In responding, he admitted to feeling exactly like the rest of us do about Justice League.The DC Movie Universe has been on a roll for the last couple years or so; 2017's Wonder Woman was a critical and box office hit, and more recently, last year's Aquaman and this year's Joker have both cleared the billion dollar mark at the worldwide box office while satisfying the fandom. Prior to these successes, though, the road was quite a bit rockier — and that rocky stretch included the entirety of Cavill's tenure as Big Blue  — so far, anyway.2013's Man of Steel led off the franchise, and while it performed respectably, it divided fans — many of whom were unprepared for writer David S. Goyer and director Zak Snyder's exceedingly dark vision of the Last Son of Krypton's tale. That flick was followed by 2016's Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, a film which probably should have broken every box office record in existence due to its pairing of the two comic book icons onscreen for the first time.The flick did clear $870 million globally, but critics were generally not impressed, and it divided audiences even more sharply; industry observers noted that the failure of a movie with both Batman and Superman in its title to make over a billion dollars was troubling. 2016's Suicide Squad, which endured a mid-production course correction aimed at injecting a bit more levity, continued the trend of earning respectable box office numbers while getting mostly trashed by critics — and then came 2017's Justice League. Wooo, boy… The team-up film reunited Ben Affleck's Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman with Cavill's Superman, and also introduced Jason Momoa's Aquaman, Ezra Miller's the Flash, and Ray Fisher's Cyborg. Despite production troubles, it was a film that should have had DC fans over the moon with excitement. It... did not. Justice League struggled to a $677 million worldwide gross, the worst performance for a DC Movie Universe film thus far — and for the reason why, look no further than Cavill's assessment of his three outings as Supes.There's no denying that Justice League indeed didn't work, although things may have turned out differently had Snyder not handed over the reins to Joss Whedon following a family tragedy. By all accounts, the film turned in by Whedon was a very, very different one from that which would have been fielded by Snyder — so much so that in the years since Justice League's release, fans have been lobbying hard for studio Warner Bros. to release Snyder's cut of the film, which the director has said would need only a few CGI tweaks to complete. Here's hoping!The movie's failure, though, has contributed to the public perception that Cavill may indeed be done playing Superman. His Dawn of Justice co-star Affleck has hung up Batman's cape and cowl for good, making way for a different, younger iteration of the Caped Crusader to be portrayed by Robert Pattinson in writer/director Matt Reeves' forthcoming The Batman; while no comparable Superman project has yet been announced, it seems like just a matter of time before Big Blue gets the reboot treatment, as well. The perception that Cavill is through was further bolstered by his non-cameo at the end of this year's Shazam!, in which Supes showed up to have a bite of lunch with the titular hero — and was portrayed by a stand-in, shown only from the neck down. For the record, though, Cavill only failed to reprise his role because of scheduling conflicts with Mission: Impossible - Fallout — and to hear the star tell it, he may not be as done with Superman as everyone seems to think he is. The actor said:The cape is still in the closet. It's still mine. I'm not just going to sit quietly in the dark as all this stuff is going on. I've not given up the role. There's a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honesty of the character I want to get into. I want to reflect the comic books. That's important to me. There's a lot of justice to be done for Superman.That is far, far more than Cavill has had to say on the subject in the last couple of years. If we're being honest, we've always felt like his version of Supes got the short end of the stick, and his obvious sense of ownership over the role has us pretty much convinced that he should be given a chance to flesh out the character in a way that his previous appearances didn't quite allow for. So: does Cavill have an actual status for us on the future of his version of Superman?According to Cavill, quote, The status is: You'll see.Watch the video to see Henry Cavill admit what we suspected all along!#HenryCavill #DCEU #Superman"

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

Between his high income and budget-conscious nature (and 20 cent iced coffee), Graham saves nearly 99% of his income.This is the latest installment of Millennial Money, which profiles people across the U.S. and details how they earn and spend their money.Read more about Graham's budget breakdown here: https://cnb.cx/2QExENLGraham Stephan pulls up to a high-end Hollywood Hills property in his matte black Tesla Model 3. It’s a four-bed, 2,300-square-foot home listed for $2.169 million by The Oppenheim Group, where Stephan has worked as a realtor since 2015.He’s sold multiple properties like it — and every time he closes a deal, he collects a nice commission check.As of September 2019, Stephan has earned $77,152 in real estate commissions on the five properties he’s sold so far this year. But that represents just a fraction of his income. While the 29-year-old millionaire got his start in real estate, he now earns most of his money making YouTube videos.Stephan, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, never dreamed he’d make his living as a YouTuber. He was earning good money as a realtor, a career he started at 18 after he didn’t get into college. He’d watched YouTube videos for years — “it was my version of TV,” he tells CNBC Make It — but didn’t think he had the personality to be a creator himself. “It looked like such a fun thing to do and I’d always wanted to do it, but I also felt like, Who would want to watch me?”About three years ago, he decided to film and upload a video. It was an explainer on how to be a successful real estate agent that he shot “selfie-style” on his iPhone.“I remember that video getting nine or 10 views,” says Stephan, “and thinking, Oh my God, nine people somewhere have seen this video! So I started making more videos. Once I started doing about two videos a week, the growth really just exploded.”Today, Stephan has close to 1.5 million subscribers across two channels. He earns an average of $90,684 a month on the platform and will bring in well over $1 million for 2019. His videos cover a range of topics, from how to build wealth as a teen to buying a Tesla “for free.” And he regularly posts reaction videos to CNBC Make It’s Millennial Money series, offering commentary on how the subjects could improve their finances.This year will be the first time he’s earned seven figures in a calendar year, a milestone he’s been striving for since 2017. “Two years ago, I made a goal challenge video,” says Stephan. “My goal was to make $1 million in 2018.” He didn’t quite achieve it, but he surprised even himself by hitting it just a year later.» Subscribe to CNBC Make It.: http://cnb.cx/2kxl2rfAbout CNBC Make It.: CNBC Make It. is a new section of CNBC dedicated to making you smarter about managing your business, career, and money.Connect with CNBC Make It.

Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chair, said that Gordon Sondland's testimony was a seminal moment in our investigation, adding that the evidence brought forward by the U.S. ambassador to the European Union was deeply significant and troubling. Schiff spoke after the testimony from Sondland on Nov. 20, in a public hearing as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Other government officials have testified that Sondland helped push Ukraine to investigate the 2016 elections, the Ukrainian company Burisma and the Biden family. In a July 25 call that has become the focus of the impeachment inquiry, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.For more on who’s who in the Trump impeachment inquiry, read: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whos-who-in-the-trump-impeachment-inquiryStream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twGFind more from PBS NewsHour at https://www.pbs.org/newshourSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6Follow us:Facebook: http://www.pbs.org/newshourTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newshourInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newshourSnapchat: @pbsnewsSubscribe:PBS NewsHour podcasts: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcastsNewsletters: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe"

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

That’s because it was her first televised performance in 2 years. The last time Selena performed live at an awards show was also at the American Music Awards in 2017, when she performed her new collaboration with Marshmallow - “Wolves”.Selena has won one American Music Award, back in 2016 for “Favorite Pop/Rock female artist”. This year though, she wasn’t nominated for any - since her music came out too late to be qualified. But she was still asked to perform and open up the ceremony. And the stakes were twice as high for Selena, who performed not one but two of her brand new songs to open up the award show. And she certainly gave an emotional performance. She started off crooning to her slow-jam “Lose You To Love Me” in a long black turtleneck. Afterwards she transformed into a disco queen with a VERY quick costume change into this sequined body-suit.She followed up her first single with her brand new hit “Look at Her Now”. And her friends Halsey and Taylor were cheering her on the entire way. But people online were a little less supportive.Some people accused her of lip-syncing her second song, “Look at Her Now”, while other people actually said that she SHOULD have lip-synced both of her songs. That’s because her performance of “Look at her now” was a bit different than the recorded version that we’re used to. This past week, Selena announced her upcoming album will come out on January 10, 2020. Right now, it’s expected to be a self-titled album, or called “SG2”, but we’re supposed to get more details on that in the next few weeks. So I’m really looking forward to seeing what comes from that.But in the meantime, keep watching our American Music Awards coverage tonight, because we’ve still got a lot coming your way!

Almost like your lift pinky. While they are magical devices that can do pretty much anything, phones aren’t invincible! Do you know, for example, that your phone uses the battery to search for reception? This will seriously drain it! By the way, don't let your phone lose its battery completely before you charge it. Just wait ‘til it gets below that 30% line. If you plug in your phone every time it gets a little below 100%, eventually, it will have a hard time recharging. So check out these tips and tricks so that your cell can stay by your side for longer!Other videos you might like:Stop Charging Your Phone at Night, Here's Why https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnb4rdaKW6k9 Signs Your Phone Isn't Your Private Zone Anymore https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHumNXawGck&Stop Using Your Phone Sitting on the Toilet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_zbGb5yBtI&TIMESTAMPS:Get rid of old apps 0:20Use Low Power Mode 0:36If you’re in an area with bad reception, turn on Airplane Mode 0:53Be smart about putting your phone in your pocket 1:17Clean your phone safely! 1:39Know when to stop doing software updates 2:03Power your phone all the way down once in a while 2:25Your phone can tell you a lot about its battery life! 2:40Staying at 100% all the time isn’t good for your phone! 2:57Don’t charge your phone overnight! 3:24Avoid charging your phone on your bed, too 3:50So, what IS the best way to charge your phone? 4:12Leave your phone alone while it’s charging! 4:40Phones don’t like extreme temperatures 5:02Invest in that screen protector 5:20Using a black wallpaper can make your battery last longer! 5:41Use the locking system on your phone 6:12Set a short Screen Timeout 6:35Try to make yourself check your screen less often 6:57A tip for travelers: turn off your phone’s location tracking! 7:25#smartphonehacks #cellphone #brightsideSUMMARY:- If you notice that you’re not using an app anymore, uninstall it from your phone. - If you know you’re going to be in an area with bad reception, turning on Airplane Mode will save your battery.- When you’re picking a phone case, get one that has a little plug for the charging port!- Use a dry cotton cloth to clean the screen and the back, like what you might clean your glasses with. - Your phone can tell you a lot about its battery life! Your phone might also be able to tell you when you last charged it. - If your phone is hooked up to your charger and keeps charging after it’s reached 100%, it can drain the battery.- Keep charging past that for hours while you’re in a deep slumber. In the morning you’ll find that your phone probably won’t stay at a very full battery for long!- If there are any tears in the cord you haven’t noticed, or if it doesn’t fit just right in your phone’s charging port, you might be at risk for a spark. - Don't let your phone lose its battery completely before you charge it; just wait ‘til it gets below that 30% line. - If you keep using your phone while it’s plugged in, it won’t charge as quickly, and the battery will drain faster after you unplug it. - If it’s super cold or super hot, it’s not good for your phone. Either one can hurt its internal parts!- If your screen is black, your phone doesn’t have to “work” to light up any brightly colored pixels.- Yeah, it might get a little annoying unlocking your phone more often, but setting a 15 to 30-second timeout can go a long way! - Each time you light up your screen, it uses a little bit of battery. Think of how much battery you’re using just to check your screen that many times a day!Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCStock materials (photos, footages and other):https://www.depositphotos.comhttps://www.shutterstock.comhttps://www.eastnews.ru----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/"

It doesn’t matter which diet plan you are following right now to lose weight, the key to your long term permanent success lies much deeper. Even science based diet plans that claim to prove the fastest way to lose body fat won’t stand the test of time if you are unable to do the most important thing when it comes to nutrition, and that is stay consistent with your approach.In this video, I show you the number one truth about nutrition and losing weight. Without consistency, your chance of keeping off the weight you lost is almost zero. The most important thing you can do is not turn to the latest pubmed studies to supposedly prove how you should be eating but rather determine if the way you decide to eat is going to be something you can do forever.I’m actually not one to demonize one way of eating over another. Instead, I encourage everyone to adopt the nutrition plan that is most conducive to their lifestyle and is going to be something that they can do for the foreseeable future. This often revolves around a much deeper ideology and one important unavoidable truth.And that is, getting ripped and losing fat is going to take commitment. Period. It is going to take a long term permanent commitment to either spending a bit more time than you are right now or money to get where you want to be. This can be boiled down to a simple three words and how they interplay together to formulate these requirements. These are fast, cheap and good. When it comes to nutrition and eating you can get fast, cheap and good but you can’t get all three. In fact, you can only choose two of these three options.  In only one world is it possible to get fast, cheap and good nutrition and that is if you are living at home with your parents and they are spending the time, money and effort to prepare your foods for you but even in this example, someone is still sacrificing something - it’s just not you.More realistically, you are going to have to choose from these other options. In fact, there are only two viable options to diet success since the fast and cheap option is usually one that isn’t conducive to what you’re trying to achieve with your body goals. When you go this route you are left with foods that are likely not healthy or good. This is a quick road to disaster and not one that is recommended.This leaves the other two options. If you go the fast and good route then you are likely going to have to take advantage of pre-cooked foods in your local Whole Foods or even start using a meal prep company to provide your meals for you. Both of these are going to require a financial commitment that you may or may not be able or ready to make. On the other hand, if you would prefer to save a good bit of money you can purchase these foods yourself in their raw, natural states and then cook them yourself. This of course if going to take much more time and is going to require that you are willing to make the time commitment to getting this done consistently.  Even if you do a full day meal prep or choose to prepare your meals daily.The fact is, you can’t escape nutrition commitment when you want to get your diet right and lose weight. Losing body fat is one of the hardest things you can do because it takes a 24/7 commitment that many people can’t make. Anyone can get themselves to go to the gym for an hour a few times a week but it takes a lot more effort to be conscientious of what you’re eating for the remaining 23 hours. Don’t get fooled by quick fixes. There is no such thing when it comes to getting ripped.If you’re looking for daily guidance on how to make this process much more automatic for you, then I think I can really help you out. My step by step meal plans are available in all of our programs available at the link below, depending on your exact training goals right now.

In responding, he admitted to feeling exactly like the rest of us do about Justice League.The DC Movie Universe has been on a roll for the last couple years or so; 2017's Wonder Woman was a critical and box office hit, and more recently, last year's Aquaman and this year's Joker have both cleared the billion dollar mark at the worldwide box office while satisfying the fandom. Prior to these successes, though, the road was quite a bit rockier — and that rocky stretch included the entirety of Cavill's tenure as Big Blue  — so far, anyway.2013's Man of Steel led off the franchise, and while it performed respectably, it divided fans — many of whom were unprepared for writer David S. Goyer and director Zak Snyder's exceedingly dark vision of the Last Son of Krypton's tale. That flick was followed by 2016's Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, a film which probably should have broken every box office record in existence due to its pairing of the two comic book icons onscreen for the first time.The flick did clear $870 million globally, but critics were generally not impressed, and it divided audiences even more sharply; industry observers noted that the failure of a movie with both Batman and Superman in its title to make over a billion dollars was troubling. 2016's Suicide Squad, which endured a mid-production course correction aimed at injecting a bit more levity, continued the trend of earning respectable box office numbers while getting mostly trashed by critics — and then came 2017's Justice League. Wooo, boy… The team-up film reunited Ben Affleck's Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman with Cavill's Superman, and also introduced Jason Momoa's Aquaman, Ezra Miller's the Flash, and Ray Fisher's Cyborg. Despite production troubles, it was a film that should have had DC fans over the moon with excitement. It... did not. Justice League struggled to a $677 million worldwide gross, the worst performance for a DC Movie Universe film thus far — and for the reason why, look no further than Cavill's assessment of his three outings as Supes.There's no denying that Justice League indeed didn't work, although things may have turned out differently had Snyder not handed over the reins to Joss Whedon following a family tragedy. By all accounts, the film turned in by Whedon was a very, very different one from that which would have been fielded by Snyder — so much so that in the years since Justice League's release, fans have been lobbying hard for studio Warner Bros. to release Snyder's cut of the film, which the director has said would need only a few CGI tweaks to complete. Here's hoping!The movie's failure, though, has contributed to the public perception that Cavill may indeed be done playing Superman. His Dawn of Justice co-star Affleck has hung up Batman's cape and cowl for good, making way for a different, younger iteration of the Caped Crusader to be portrayed by Robert Pattinson in writer/director Matt Reeves' forthcoming The Batman; while no comparable Superman project has yet been announced, it seems like just a matter of time before Big Blue gets the reboot treatment, as well. The perception that Cavill is through was further bolstered by his non-cameo at the end of this year's Shazam!, in which Supes showed up to have a bite of lunch with the titular hero — and was portrayed by a stand-in, shown only from the neck down. For the record, though, Cavill only failed to reprise his role because of scheduling conflicts with Mission: Impossible - Fallout — and to hear the star tell it, he may not be as done with Superman as everyone seems to think he is. The actor said:The cape is still in the closet. It's still mine. I'm not just going to sit quietly in the dark as all this stuff is going on. I've not given up the role. There's a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honesty of the character I want to get into. I want to reflect the comic books. That's important to me. There's a lot of justice to be done for Superman.That is far, far more than Cavill has had to say on the subject in the last couple of years. If we're being honest, we've always felt like his version of Supes got the short end of the stick, and his obvious sense of ownership over the role has us pretty much convinced that he should be given a chance to flesh out the character in a way that his previous appearances didn't quite allow for. So: does Cavill have an actual status for us on the future of his version of Superman?According to Cavill, quote, The status is: You'll see.Watch the video to see Henry Cavill admit what we suspected all along!#HenryCavill #DCEU #Superman"

In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

A millionaire by 26, Graham’s income fluctuates between $60,000 and $221,000 per month depending on how much he earns from real estate commissions and YouTube related-revenue. He also owns several rental properties in the Los Angeles area. Between his high income and budget-conscious nature (and 20 cent iced coffee), Graham saves nearly 99% of his income.This is the latest installment of Millennial Money, which profiles people across the U.S. and details how they earn and spend their money.Read more about Graham's budget breakdown here: https://cnb.cx/2QExENLGraham Stephan pulls up to a high-end Hollywood Hills property in his matte black Tesla Model 3. It’s a four-bed, 2,300-square-foot home listed for $2.169 million by The Oppenheim Group, where Stephan has worked as a realtor since 2015.He’s sold multiple properties like it — and every time he closes a deal, he collects a nice commission check.As of September 2019, Stephan has earned $77,152 in real estate commissions on the five properties he’s sold so far this year. But that represents just a fraction of his income. While the 29-year-old millionaire got his start in real estate, he now earns most of his money making YouTube videos.Stephan, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, never dreamed he’d make his living as a YouTuber. He was earning good money as a realtor, a career he started at 18 after he didn’t get into college. He’d watched YouTube videos for years — “it was my version of TV,” he tells CNBC Make It — but didn’t think he had the personality to be a creator himself. “It looked like such a fun thing to do and I’d always wanted to do it, but I also felt like, Who would want to watch me?”About three years ago, he decided to film and upload a video. It was an explainer on how to be a successful real estate agent that he shot “selfie-style” on his iPhone.“I remember that video getting nine or 10 views,” says Stephan, “and thinking, Oh my God, nine people somewhere have seen this video! So I started making more videos. Once I started doing about two videos a week, the growth really just exploded.”Today, Stephan has close to 1.5 million subscribers across two channels. He earns an average of $90,684 a month on the platform and will bring in well over $1 million for 2019. His videos cover a range of topics, from how to build wealth as a teen to buying a Tesla “for free.” And he regularly posts reaction videos to CNBC Make It’s Millennial Money series, offering commentary on how the subjects could improve their finances.This year will be the first time he’s earned seven figures in a calendar year, a milestone he’s been striving for since 2017. “Two years ago, I made a goal challenge video,” says Stephan. “My goal was to make $1 million in 2018.” He didn’t quite achieve it, but he surprised even himself by hitting it just a year later.» Subscribe to CNBC Make It.: http://cnb.cx/2kxl2rfAbout CNBC Make It.: CNBC Make It. is a new section of CNBC dedicated to making you smarter about managing your business, career, and money.Connect with CNBC Make It.

Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chair, said that Gordon Sondland's testimony was a seminal moment in our investigation, adding that the evidence brought forward by the U.S. ambassador to the European Union was deeply significant and troubling. Schiff spoke after the testimony from Sondland on Nov. 20, in a public hearing as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Other government officials have testified that Sondland helped push Ukraine to investigate the 2016 elections, the Ukrainian company Burisma and the Biden family. In a July 25 call that has become the focus of the impeachment inquiry, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.For more on who’s who in the Trump impeachment inquiry, read: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whos-who-in-the-trump-impeachment-inquiryStream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twGFind more from PBS NewsHour at https://www.pbs.org/newshourSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6Follow us:Facebook: http://www.pbs.org/newshourTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newshourInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newshourSnapchat: @pbsnewsSubscribe:PBS NewsHour podcasts: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcastsNewsletters: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe"

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

At initial glance, you might think wow, that's an impressive feat. Surely the Tesla's electric torque helps it rip the F-150 in this battle of who's got the bigger driveshaft? Unfortunately, physics informs us these kind of demonstrations are entirely pointless.We'll discuss the actual wheel torque of the Tesla Cybertruck as well as the Ford F-150, we'll look into both vehicles weights, and we'll analyze the video to determine if the Ford is RWD or 4WD.

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! Growing up, Lizzie never realized how deeply she was affected by what she saw on the news and experienced at school. But when she took the time to look back, she started to understand that events she experienced really impacted her way of thinking and daily life, and the level of her anxiety. When Lizzie was younger, she lived at Fort Hood - the biggest U.S. military base in the country. She was there when a horrible shooting happened. The day after the horrific event, she went to school and saw armed guards surrounding the building. When she approached a guard, he assured her that he was there to protect her. But because Lizzie was so young, she didn't understand why she needed to be protected at school. At such a young age, the whole thing was really confusing. Then, when Lizzie was in middle school, another student brought a weapon to school. The student was caught before he was able to use his weapon, and the school was able to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. However, even though Lizzie was so grateful that things didn't escalate, the whole experience still really scared her. After that, Lizzie felt a similar sense of fear, confusion and sadness when she heard about the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook. She couldn't imagine how the victims must have felt, and she hugged her younger brother and told him she loved him after hearing about what happened on the news. Then, when Lizzie was a senior in high school, she found out about another tragedy at Stoneman Douglas. As much as it broke her heart to hear about yet another school shooting, Lizzie couldn't help but feel numb to the pain - and that scared her even more. After each event, Lizzie became more anxious in her daily life. When her school had an active shooter drill, she couldn't help but fear the worst, and she immediately texted her brother to make sure he was okay. Lizzie believes that, although this is hard for anyone to comprehend, it is especially difficult for kids and teenagers. She doesn't understand why her generation has to feel any sense of fear when walking into a school, going to a store or heading to a movie. She may think to herself, When did this become normal? However, Lizzie has hope for the future. She thinks that her generation will be the change that the world needs to make a difference, and she is hopeful that future generations will not have experience what Lizzie and her classmates went through.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

That’s because it was her first televised performance in 2 years. The last time Selena performed live at an awards show was also at the American Music Awards in 2017, when she performed her new collaboration with Marshmallow - “Wolves”.Selena has won one American Music Award, back in 2016 for “Favorite Pop/Rock female artist”. This year though, she wasn’t nominated for any - since her music came out too late to be qualified. But she was still asked to perform and open up the ceremony. And the stakes were twice as high for Selena, who performed not one but two of her brand new songs to open up the award show. And she certainly gave an emotional performance. She started off crooning to her slow-jam “Lose You To Love Me” in a long black turtleneck. Afterwards she transformed into a disco queen with a VERY quick costume change into this sequined body-suit.She followed up her first single with her brand new hit “Look at Her Now”. And her friends Halsey and Taylor were cheering her on the entire way. But people online were a little less supportive.Some people accused her of lip-syncing her second song, “Look at Her Now”, while other people actually said that she SHOULD have lip-synced both of her songs. That’s because her performance of “Look at her now” was a bit different than the recorded version that we’re used to. This past week, Selena announced her upcoming album will come out on January 10, 2020. Right now, it’s expected to be a self-titled album, or called “SG2”, but we’re supposed to get more details on that in the next few weeks. So I’m really looking forward to seeing what comes from that.But in the meantime, keep watching our American Music Awards coverage tonight, because we’ve still got a lot coming your way!

Almost like your lift pinky. While they are magical devices that can do pretty much anything, phones aren’t invincible! Do you know, for example, that your phone uses the battery to search for reception? This will seriously drain it! By the way, don't let your phone lose its battery completely before you charge it. Just wait ‘til it gets below that 30% line. If you plug in your phone every time it gets a little below 100%, eventually, it will have a hard time recharging.

Your phone might also be able to tell you when you last charged it. - If your phone is hooked up to your charger and keeps charging after it’s reached 100%, it can drain the battery.- Keep charging past that for hours while you’re in a deep slumber. In the morning you’ll find that your phone probably won’t stay at a very full battery for long!- If there are any tears in the cord you haven’t noticed, or if it doesn’t fit just right in your phone’s charging port, you might be at risk for a spark. - Don't let your phone lose its battery completely before you charge it; just wait ‘til it gets below that 30% line. - If you keep using your phone while it’s plugged in, it won’t charge as quickly, and the battery will drain faster after you unplug it. - If it’s super cold or super hot, it’s not good for your phone. Either one can hurt its internal parts!- If your screen is black, your phone doesn’t have to “work” to light up any brightly colored pixels.- Yeah, it might get a little annoying unlocking your phone more often, but setting a 15 to 30-second timeout can go a long way! - Each time you light up your screen, it uses a little bit of battery. Think of how much battery you’re using just to check your screen that many times a day!Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCStock materials (photos, footages and other):https://www.depositphotos.comhttps://www.shutterstock.comhttps://www.eastnews.ru----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/"

It doesn’t matter which diet plan you are following right now to lose weight, the key to your long term permanent success lies much deeper. Even science based diet plans that claim to prove the fastest way to lose body fat won’t stand the test of time if you are unable to do the most important thing when it comes to nutrition, and that is stay consistent with your approach.In this video, I show you the number one truth about nutrition and losing weight. Without consistency, your chance of keeping off the weight you lost is almost zero. The most important thing you can do is not turn to the latest pubmed studies to supposedly prove how you should be eating but rather determine if the way you decide to eat is going to be something you can do forever.I’m actually not one to demonize one way of eating over another. Instead, I encourage everyone to adopt the nutrition plan that is most conducive to their lifestyle and is going to be something that they can do for the foreseeable future. This often revolves around a much deeper ideology and one important unavoidable truth.And that is, getting ripped and losing fat is going to take commitment. Period. It is going to take a long term permanent commitment to either spending a bit more time than you are right now or money to get where you want to be. This can be boiled down to a simple three words and how they interplay together to formulate these requirements. These are fast, cheap and good. When it comes to nutrition and eating you can get fast, cheap and good but you can’t get all three. In fact, you can only choose two of these three options.  In only one world is it possible to get fast, cheap and good nutrition and that is if you are living at home with your parents and they are spending the time, money and effort to prepare your foods for you but even in this example, someone is still sacrificing something - it’s just not you.More realistically, you are going to have to choose from these other options. In fact, there are only two viable options to diet success since the fast and cheap option is usually one that isn’t conducive to what you’re trying to achieve with your body goals. When you go this route you are left with foods that are likely not healthy or good. This is a quick road to disaster and not one that is recommended.This leaves the other two options. If you go the fast and good route then you are likely going to have to take advantage of pre-cooked foods in your local Whole Foods or even start using a meal prep company to provide your meals for you. Both of these are going to require a financial commitment that you may or may not be able or ready to make. On the other hand, if you would prefer to save a good bit of money you can purchase these foods yourself in their raw, natural states and then cook them yourself. This of course if going to take much more time and is going to require that you are willing to make the time commitment to getting this done consistently.  Even if you do a full day meal prep or choose to prepare your meals daily.The fact is, you can’t escape nutrition commitment when you want to get your diet right and lose weight. Losing body fat is one of the hardest things you can do because it takes a 24/7 commitment that many people can’t make. Anyone can get themselves to go to the gym for an hour a few times a week but it takes a lot more effort to be conscientious of what you’re eating for the remaining 23 hours. Don’t get fooled by quick fixes. There is no such thing when it comes to getting ripped.If you’re looking for daily guidance on how to make this process much more automatic for you, then I think I can really help you out. My step by step meal plans are available in all of our programs available at the link below, depending on your exact training goals right now.

In responding, he admitted to feeling exactly like the rest of us do about Justice League.The DC Movie Universe has been on a roll for the last couple years or so; 2017's Wonder Woman was a critical and box office hit, and more recently, last year's Aquaman and this year's Joker have both cleared the billion dollar mark at the worldwide box office while satisfying the fandom. Prior to these successes, though, the road was quite a bit rockier — and that rocky stretch included the entirety of Cavill's tenure as Big Blue  — so far, anyway.2013's Man of Steel led off the franchise, and while it performed respectably, it divided fans — many of whom were unprepared for writer David S. Goyer and director Zak Snyder's exceedingly dark vision of the Last Son of Krypton's tale. That flick was followed by 2016's Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, a film which probably should have broken every box office record in existence due to its pairing of the two comic book icons onscreen for the first time.The flick did clear $870 million globally, but critics were generally not impressed, and it divided audiences even more sharply; industry observers noted that the failure of a movie with both Batman and Superman in its title to make over a billion dollars was troubling. 2016's Suicide Squad, which endured a mid-production course correction aimed at injecting a bit more levity, continued the trend of earning respectable box office numbers while getting mostly trashed by critics — and then came 2017's Justice League. Wooo, boy… The team-up film reunited Ben Affleck's Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman with Cavill's Superman, and also introduced Jason Momoa's Aquaman, Ezra Miller's the Flash, and Ray Fisher's Cyborg. Despite production troubles, it was a film that should have had DC fans over the moon with excitement. It... did not. Justice League struggled to a $677 million worldwide gross, the worst performance for a DC Movie Universe film thus far — and for the reason why, look no further than Cavill's assessment of his three outings as Supes.There's no denying that Justice League indeed didn't work, although things may have turned out differently had Snyder not handed over the reins to Joss Whedon following a family tragedy. By all accounts, the film turned in by Whedon was a very, very different one from that which would have been fielded by Snyder — so much so that in the years since Justice League's release, fans have been lobbying hard for studio Warner Bros. to release Snyder's cut of the film, which the director has said would need only a few CGI tweaks to complete. Here's hoping!The movie's failure, though, has contributed to the public perception that Cavill may indeed be done playing Superman. His Dawn of Justice co-star Affleck has hung up Batman's cape and cowl for good, making way for a different, younger iteration of the Caped Crusader to be portrayed by Robert Pattinson in writer/director Matt Reeves' forthcoming The Batman; while no comparable Superman project has yet been announced, it seems like just a matter of time before Big Blue gets the reboot treatment, as well. The perception that Cavill is through was further bolstered by his non-cameo at the end of this year's Shazam!, in which Supes showed up to have a bite of lunch with the titular hero — and was portrayed by a stand-in, shown only from the neck down. For the record, though, Cavill only failed to reprise his role because of scheduling conflicts with Mission: Impossible - Fallout — and to hear the star tell it, he may not be as done with Superman as everyone seems to think he is. The actor said:The cape is still in the closet. It's still mine. I'm not just going to sit quietly in the dark as all this stuff is going on. I've not given up the role. There's a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honesty of the character I want to get into. I want to reflect the comic books. That's important to me. There's a lot of justice to be done for Superman.That is far, far more than Cavill has had to say on the subject in the last couple of years. If we're being honest, we've always felt like his version of Supes got the short end of the stick, and his obvious sense of ownership over the role has us pretty much convinced that he should be given a chance to flesh out the character in a way that his previous appearances didn't quite allow for. So: does Cavill have an actual status for us on the future of his version of Superman?According to Cavill, quote, The status is: You'll see.Watch the video to see Henry Cavill admit what we suspected all along!#HenryCavill #DCEU #Superman"

What truths about the past await Elsa as she ventures into the unknown to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond Arendelle? The answers are calling her but also threatening her kingdom.

In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

A millionaire by 26, Graham’s income fluctuates between $60,000 and $221,000 per month depending on how much he earns from real estate commissions and YouTube related-revenue. He also owns several rental properties in the Los Angeles area. Between his high income and budget-conscious nature (and 20 cent iced coffee), Graham saves nearly 99% of his income.This is the latest installment of Millennial Money, which profiles people across the U.S. and details how they earn and spend their money.Read more about Graham's budget breakdown here: https://cnb.cx/2QExENLGraham Stephan pulls up to a high-end Hollywood Hills property in his matte black Tesla Model 3. It’s a four-bed, 2,300-square-foot home listed for $2.169 million by The Oppenheim Group, where Stephan has worked as a realtor since 2015.He’s sold multiple properties like it — and every time he closes a deal, he collects a nice commission check.As of September 2019, Stephan has earned $77,152 in real estate commissions on the five properties he’s sold so far this year. But that represents just a fraction of his income. While the 29-year-old millionaire got his start in real estate, he now earns most of his money making YouTube videos.Stephan, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, never dreamed he’d make his living as a YouTuber. He was earning good money as a realtor, a career he started at 18 after he didn’t get into college. He’d watched YouTube videos for years — “it was my version of TV,” he tells CNBC Make It — but didn’t think he had the personality to be a creator himself. “It looked like such a fun thing to do and I’d always wanted to do it, but I also felt like, Who would want to watch me?”About three years ago, he decided to film and upload a video. It was an explainer on how to be a successful real estate agent that he shot “selfie-style” on his iPhone.“I remember that video getting nine or 10 views,” says Stephan, “and thinking, Oh my God, nine people somewhere have seen this video! So I started making more videos. Once I started doing about two videos a week, the growth really just exploded.”Today, Stephan has close to 1.5 million subscribers across two channels. He earns an average of $90,684 a month on the platform and will bring in well over $1 million for 2019. His videos cover a range of topics, from how to build wealth as a teen to buying a Tesla “for free.” And he regularly posts reaction videos to CNBC Make It’s Millennial Money series, offering commentary on how the subjects could improve their finances.This year will be the first time he’s earned seven figures in a calendar year, a milestone he’s been striving for since 2017. “Two years ago, I made a goal challenge video,” says Stephan. “My goal was to make $1 million in 2018.” He didn’t quite achieve it, but he surprised even himself by hitting it just a year later.» Subscribe to CNBC Make It.: http://cnb.cx/2kxl2rfAbout CNBC Make It.: CNBC Make It. is a new section of CNBC dedicated to making you smarter about managing your business, career, and money.Connect with CNBC Make It.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chair, said that Gordon Sondland's testimony was a seminal moment in our investigation, adding that the evidence brought forward by the U.S. ambassador to the European Union was deeply significant and troubling. Schiff spoke after the testimony from Sondland on Nov. 20, in a public hearing as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Other government officials have testified that Sondland helped push Ukraine to investigate the 2016 elections, the Ukrainian company Burisma and the Biden family. In a July 25 call that has become the focus of the impeachment inquiry, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.For more on who’s who in the Trump impeachment inquiry, read: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whos-who-in-the-trump-impeachment-inquiryStream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twGFind more from PBS NewsHour at https://www.pbs.org/newshourSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6Follow us:Facebook: http://www.pbs.org/newshourTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newshourInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newshourSnapchat: @pbsnewsSubscribe:PBS NewsHour podcasts: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcastsNewsletters: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe"

We are slated to open Karne Steakhouse in Houston, Texas, and these items with the exception of the cheesy pasta and #sake pairing will be on the non-BBQ part of the menu.
